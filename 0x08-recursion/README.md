# 0x08 - RECURSION
In this project, we explore the art of recursive programming

## What is Recursion
Recursion is a solution to a problem where the solution to a problem depends on other smaller instances of the same problem

## What is a Recursive Function
A recursive function is simply a function that calls itself

## What is the Base Case
The Base case is the condition that ends a recursiveness. Simply, it allows your recursive function to stop recursing

## Where can Recursion be Used?
1. Problems with a recursive structure: Recursion is particularly useful for problems that exhibit a recursive structure. For example, tree-based problems like traversing or searching in a binary tree, or problems involving linked lists, can be naturally solved using recursion.

2. Divide and conquer algorithms: Many divide and conquer algorithms, such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort, use recursion. They break down a problem into smaller subproblems, recursively solve those subproblems, and then combine their solutions to get the final answer.

3. Backtracking problems: Problems that require exhaustive exploration of all possible solutions, such as finding all permutations or combinations of a set, can be effectively solved using recursion with backtracking.

4. Dynamic Programming: Certain dynamic programming problems can be solved using recursion with memoization (storing previously computed results to avoid redundant computations). Although it is possible to solve many dynamic programming problems iteratively, recursive solutions with memoization can be more intuitive and easier to implement.

5. Fibonacci sequence and factorial problems: Classic examples of recursion involve computing the Fibonacci sequence or calculating factorials.

6. Parsing and tree traversals: Recursive descent parsing is a technique used in many parsers, and tree traversals like depth-first traversal can be naturally implemented using recursion.

7. Graph traversal and searching: Recursive algorithms can be used for graph traversal (e.g., Depth-First Search) and searching problems.
