# 0x01 - Variables, If, Else, While
In this project, we explore the different types of varibles that exists, arithmetic. logical and relational operators and conditional statements

## What are Identifiers and  Keywords
Keywords/reserved keywords are words that cannot be used by identifiers. They already serve a special function in C programming. On the other hand, Identifiers are names that we give to variables and functions.

## Arithmetic, Logical and Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two values and return either true or false(e.g >, <, ==). Logical operators perform logical operations on true and false(e.g &&, ||). Values used with logical operators are converted to booleans prior to being evaluated.

## About ASCII
ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a 7-bit standard data-encoding format for electronic communication between computers.

## Difference between `puts` and `putchar`
`puts` is used to print out a string. putchar is used to print out a character. `putchar` can be used to print a number if we do this: `putchar(number + '0')`.
