# 0x02 - Functions, Nested Loops
In this project, we learn about functions, nesting and header files

## What are Functions?
A function is a reusable block of code that takes in input, perfoms a specific action on the input taken and gives out an output based on the data passed in.

## Function Definition and Function Declaration
Function definition is the contains the return type, parameters, name and body of the function. function declaration tells the compiler about the function name and how to call the function.

## What is the Use of a Function Prototype
1. It tells us the return type of the function
2. It tells us the number of arguments passed to the function
3. It tells us the data type of arguments passed to the function
4. It tells us the order in which the arguments are passed

## What is a Header file
This is a file that contains funtion declarations and macros to be shared between source files. These files usually ends with a `.h`. There are two types of header files that we can have: the files that a programmer writes and a file that comes with your compiler.
